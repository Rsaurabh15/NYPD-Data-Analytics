🚔 Case Study on NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions

A data visualization and analysis project using IBM Cognos Analytics to uncover insights from the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset.  
This project identifies patterns, high-risk locations, and trends to help improve road safety in New York City.


📊 Overview

This project imports the NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset into IBM Cognos, builds a Data Module, and creates interactive dashboards to address real-world traffic safety problems.  
It includes both standard and scenario-based problems, analyzed through charts, heatmaps, maps, and crosstabs.


📂 Dataset

Source: NYPD Open Data (Motor Vehicle Collisions)  

Key Features:
- Date & time of accidents  
- Location (borough, streets, intersections)  
- Vehicle types involved  
- Contributing factors  
- Number of injuries and fatalities  
- Pedestrian, cyclist, and motorist data  

❓ Problem Statements

Standard Problems:
1. Show the total number of injuries and fatalities.  
2. Show summaries for pedestrian, cyclist, and motorist injuries.  
3. Show injuries by year.  
4. Show injuries based on vehicle contribution factors.  

Scenario-Based Problems:
5. Injuries filtered by city, month, and year.  
6. Map view of streets with high injury rates.  
7. Crosstab of injuries by month.  
8. Identify cities/streets with high animal-related accidents.  
9. Identify areas to start a traffic awareness campaign.  
10. Suggest top 7 locations for new heavy-vehicle lanes.  


🛠 Methodology

- Data Module Creation – Unified view of data in IBM Cognos.  
- Data Preparation – Joining, filtering, and calculating key fields.  
- Dashboard Creation – Using summary, bar, map, heatmap, network, and crosstab visualizations.  
- Filtering & Drill-downs – To analyze specific boroughs, months, and accident causes.
